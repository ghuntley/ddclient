	"It has the capability to update more than only <a href=\"http://dyndns.org\">" .
	"dyndns</a> and it can fetch your WAN-ipaddress on a few different ways.  Check the " .

	"DDclient is a small but full featured client requiring only Perl " .
	"and no additional modules. It runs under most UNIX OSes and has " .
	"been tested under GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. Supported features " .
	"include: operating as a daemon, manual and automatic updates, " .
	"static and dynamic updates, optimized updates for multiple " .

Ddclient doesn't have any automatic installation procedure.  Get the tar-file 
from " . $link['download'] .  " and untar it.  Copy the perl script to your
favorit location (ex. /usr/sbin) and create a /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf 
configuration file.  If you want the bleeding edge of ddclient, you can get
the subversion-version using
<pre> svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ddclient/trunk/svn ddclient</pre>
</p><p>
There are a few configuration examples provided which you can copy to 
/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf and modify. More info about the configuration
can be found on the <a href=\"?page=1\">usage page</a>.  There's also 
a sample configuration delivered with ddclient.
</p>
<p>
A typical configuration like:
<div class=\"code\">
<pre>
#
# /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf
#
protocol=dyndns2
use=web
login=mylogin
password=mypassword
myhost.dyndns.org
</pre>
</div>
</p>
<p>
You can run ddclient as &quot;/usr/sbin/ddclient -daemon 300 -syslog&quot; 
and put it in your startup scripts.  There are samples of startup scripts
provided with ddclient.

<p>
The documentation about the configuration has been splitted in three
sections.  The <a href=\"?page=1\">usage page</a> describes the most parts
of the configuration while the <a href=\"?page=2\">supported protocols</a> 
page describes the protocol-specific options.  If you want to know how 
to use ddclient with your router, check the 
<a href=\"?page=3\">supported routers</a>.

Debugging ddclient looks pretty hard but it isn't.  First try to put \n".
	"as less as necessary in your configuration. Try to run \n".
	"`./ddclient -daemon=0 -noquiet -debug` and check the result. \n" .
	"Try to add the features you need and check it again.  Once \n".
	"you're happy with the result, run it as a daemon.\n" .
	"<p>\n" .
	"<p>\n" .
	"If this doesn't work for you, \n".
	"there are a few places where you can look for help.  If you need \n".
	"any help in configuring ddclient, you could try ddclient --help. \n".
	"It should give you all the possible configuration options so.\n" .
	"</p>\n".
	"<p>\n" .
	"If you think your configuration is correct, but ddclient doesn't \n" .
	"work as you expected, you can enable debug and verbose messages \n" .
	"by running ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet.\n".
